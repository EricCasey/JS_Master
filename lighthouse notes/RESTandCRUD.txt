HTTP is stateless while REST is restful? (remembers)

CRUD - Create Read Update Delete is a set of operations performed on data records. This applies mainly when dealing with databases.

REST -- Representational State Transfer is a set of conventions and practices in web development that deals with accessing and manipulating resources over HTTP.

CRUD means the basic operations to be done in a data repository. You directly handle records or data objects; apart from these operations, the records are passive entities. Typically it's just database tables and records.
REST, on the other hand, operates on resource representations, each one identified by an URL. These are typically not data objects, but complex objects abstractions.


CREATE
> POST /tunes   // creates tunes

READ
> GET /tunes    // reads /tunes

UPDATE
> PUT /tunes      //
