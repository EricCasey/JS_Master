What is JQuery?  change content based on user actions. The more universally used language to access the DOM on all browsers

Uses

2. change HTML content
3. listen to what a user does and react accordingly
4. animate content on hte page
5/ talk over the network to fetch new content

DOM or Document OBject Model   ----   organizes tags like a cascading tree


jQuery("h1"); is the same as $("h1");


METHODS

$("h1").text();   ----   returns the text within H1
$("h2").text("this is now change");  ---- this replaces the text in H1
$("div").find("li");     ---- finds that element within the other
$("<div>")    --- creates a closed div element





$(document).ready(function(){   <code>    });    ---- this runs the function only when the document is ready

make sure you load JQuery into your file to use it!!!!!!
